About Bootcamp!

Bootcamp provides a learning path to get into security and especially web penetration testing.
This course is a list of things to read and do. No solutions are provided since it is, in my opinion, the best and only way to learn. If you don't manage to get one of the items done, just try harder, spend more time googling until you find the solution. Finding something by yourself is the best way to remember it.
1
Linux and scripting
Reading list:

Hypertext Transfer Protocol
Domain Name System
Whois
Network socket

Hands on:

Install Linux: Retrieve a virtualisation system (VirtualBox, VM player) and install Linux. Use a traditional distribution like Ubuntu not a security related one.
Learn the basics of a scripting language: Pick between Ruby (Try Ruby), Python (Online) or Perl and learn its syntax and data types. You will need it to keep going.
2
HTTP
Reading list:

TCP/IP
Secure Sockets Layer
Hands on:

Install Apache inside your vm, change the home page of the hosted site using vim. Access this page in your browser (on the host).
Change your host file to access the Linux system under the following names: vulnerable
Write an HTTP client to retrieve the home page of your site using an http library (for example net/http in ruby).
Write an HTTP client to retrieve the home page of your site using a socket.
Download Burp Suite (free version) and visit a website and see what requests are sent and what responses are received.
3
PHP and DNS
Reading list:

Learn about virtual hosting
and how to setup vhosts with Apache
Zone transfer
Hands on:

PHP basics:
Install PHP in your virtual machine (using your previous Apache installation), write a script that echoes back a parameter in the URL. For example, accessing http://vulnerable/hello.php?name=Louis will return "Hello Louis".
Install Mysql and create a script that retrieves information from it, like article.php?id=1 returns a book and article.php?id=2 returns a computer.
Create a page that sends data to itself using a POST request.
DNS and whois:
Install the command line tool dig in your vm.
Find what name servers are used by PentesterLab, find what Mail servers are used by pentesterlab and find the Ip address of www.pentesterlab.com
Obtain information about pentesterlab.com using the whois tool.
4
SSL/TLS
Reading list:

SQL injection
Remote File Inclusion
Hands on:

Setup SSL:
enable HTTPs on your web server
make sure you disabled all the weak ciphers.
Play with SSL:
write a SSL client using an HTTP library
write a SSL client using a socket
acces your SSL server with your previous HTTP script and socat to do the connection socket<->ssl-socket
5
SQL injection & Local File Include

MIME
Hands on:

Follow From SQL injection to Shell: read the course and test on the ISO
Follow PHP Include And Post Exploitation: read the course and test on the ISO
6
More SQL injection
Reading list:

Antisec Movement
DHCP
FTP
Request for Comments
Hands on:

Check if the code you wrote during Week 3 is vulnerable to SQL injection
7
FTP and traffic analysis
Reading list:

Phrack
Phrack: Happy Hacking
Phrack profile on FX
Hands on:

Install and use Wireshark: inspect the traffic send by your HTTP client (use "Follow TCP stream) and HTTPs client (check the SSL handshake)

HTTP server
Write a HTTP server (use fork to handle more than one connection)
Connect to your HTTP server with your browser and check the requests done by your browser
Iptables
If enabled, disable iptables in your vm
Use iptables to block ICMP requests, test if it works using ping
10
Nmap and Crypto Attacks
Reading list:

Wifi
WEP
WAP
Hands on:

Nmap
Use Nmap to find the open ports on your VM
Use Nmap to find the open ports on your VM while blocking ICMP using iptables
Use iptables to close one of the open port, check that it works using Nmap
Find a local security meetup (Ruxmon, 2600...) and go there
